✅Exercise 3: Assertions in JUnit
This project demonstrates how to use various JUnit assertions to write effective unit tests in Java. Assertions are essential for verifying that your code produces the expected output and behaves correctly under different conditions.

📌 Objectives
1.Understand and use common JUnit assertions
2.Learn how to validate test conditions using assertEquals, assertTrue, assertFalse, assertNull, and assertNotNull
3.Build confidence in testing different types of logic in Java applications

🧪 Test Class Overview
The AssertionsTest class includes examples of:

✅ assertEquals – checks if two values are equal

✅ assertTrue – checks if a condition is true

✅ assertFalse – checks if a condition is false

✅ assertNull – verifies that a value is null

✅ assertNotNull – verifies that a value is not null

🛠️ How to Run
Clone the repository
Open the project in your IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ)
Make sure JUnit 4.13.2 is added to the classpath
Run the AssertionsTest class as a JUnit Test
