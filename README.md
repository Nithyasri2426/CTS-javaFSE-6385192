# DN 4.0 - Java FSE Mandatory Hands-On by CTS

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains hands-on Java exercises designed as part of the **DN 4.0 Full Stack Engineer (FSE)** learning path at **Cognizant (CTS)**. The goal is to reinforce practical understanding of key software development concepts, including design patterns, algorithms, and data structures, through structured coding assignments.

## 🗂️ Contents

### 🔷 Design Patterns and Principles
Covers object-oriented design principles and classic design patterns:

1. **Singleton Pattern** – Consistent logging utility with a single instance
2. **Factory Method Pattern** – Document creation (Word, PDF, Excel)
3. **Builder Pattern** – Constructing complex `Computer` objects
4. **Adapter Pattern** – Payment processing system integration
5. **Decorator Pattern** – Notification system (Email, SMS, Slack)
6. **Proxy Pattern** – Lazy-loaded remote image viewer
7. **Observer Pattern** – Stock market monitoring updates
8. **Strategy Pattern** – Runtime selection of payment strategies
9. **Command Pattern** – Home automation with on/off commands
10. **MVC Pattern** – Web app for managing student records
11. **Dependency Injection** – Customer service and repository layering

### 🔷 Algorithms and Data Structures
Focuses on applying algorithmic techniques to real-world systems:

1. **Inventory Management System** – CRUD operations with `HashMap`
2. **E-commerce Search Function** – Linear and Binary Search with time complexity analysis
3. **Sorting Customer Orders** – Bubble Sort and Quick Sort for order prioritization
4. **Employee Management System** – Array operations for employee records
5. **Task Management System** – Linked List implementation for task tracking
6. **Library Management System** – Searching books with linear and binary search
7. **Financial Forecasting** – Recursive prediction of future values using growth rates
